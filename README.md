# Reaction-Timer-using-DE-10-Lite
This Reaction Timer on the DE10-Lite FPGA uses Verilog to measure reaction time accurately. It features a clock divider, 1.5s delay, timer, LED indicators, high-score register, FSM, and SSD controller to display time on HEX displays. It demonstrates digital design, timing, and FPGA-based hardware/software integration.
